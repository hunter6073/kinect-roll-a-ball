# kinect-roll-a-ball
Description:
This is a classic roll-a-ball game created using unity.
You will find the scenes very similar to the one in Unity tutorial(cause I built this game upon that tutorial, this is my first game ever!) 
This game has 3 build versions:
1. Android
2. PC
3. Kinect
You can play the game using either version, a built kinect version is stored in the game folder.
However you will need to connect a kinect to a computer to play this game.
I will be releasing the PC build and Android build here soon for demo effect
Cheers!
